Product Vision
---------------
As a mix of homeoffice and working in the office is becoming more popular, many companies are reducing the number of desks in the workplace to save money. Deskstar allows employees to book desks from home to make sure they have a workplace available when traveling to the office. This way unnecessary trips are avoided when no desks are available and companies can find out in which areas more bookable resources are needed. Our service thus makes the lives of companies and their employees easier regarding novel hybrid working spaces.

Project Mission
---------------
Our project mission is to create a prototype version of a shared desk management system in the given timeframe as a web application supporting the most important requirements of our industry partner. Our system will cover basic booking functionalities for users as well as resource and user management for admins. To meet this goal, we will maintain a strong relationship within the team and with the industry partner and work together in a friendly atmosphere.
